    The AIAA through the Applied Aerodynamics, Aircraft Design, Design Engineering and Flight Test Technical
    Committees and the AIAA Foundation invites all university students to participate in the Textron Aviation/Raytheon
    Student Design, Build, Fly Competition. The contest will provide a real-world airplane design experience for
    engineering students by giving them the opportunity to validate their analytic studies.
                
    Student teams will design, fabricate, and demonstrate the flight capabilities of an electric powered, remote-
    controlled airplane that can best meet the specified mission profile. The goal is a balanced design possessing good
    flight handling qualities and practical and affordable manufacturing requirements while demonstrating high vehicle
    performance.
                
    To encourage innovation and maintain a fresh design challenge, the design requirements and performance objectives
    are updated for each new contest year. The changes provide new design requirements and opportunities, while
    allowing for application of technology developed by the teams from prior years.
                
    Check the rules package carefully as items and approaches that were legal in past years may not be legal for this
    contest year. Only the contents of this year's Rules package along with the current FAQ and Q&A documents hold
    bearing on the requirements and/or allowances for the current contest year.
                
    NOTE: Items in the rules that are critical to the safety and execution of the competition or are new are hi-lighted
    in RED text. Please take note of these requirements and rules.
                
    It is the responsibility of the teams to know and follow all provided rules, the FAQ and Q&A, and all contest day
    briefings.
                
    Cash prizes are 3000 for 1st, 2000 for 2nd and 1500 for 3rd place. The winning team(s) may be invited to present
    their design at AIAA's AVIATION Forum. The team with the best Report Score will receive a 100 prize from the
    Design Engineering Technical Committee.

All team members (except for a non-student pilot) must be full time students at an accredited University or College
and student members of the AIAA. Team members may include graduate students. At least 1/3 of the team
members must consist of freshman, sophomores or juniors (below senior year, for non-four year programs). The
pilot must be an AMA (Academy of Model Aeronautics) member. Teams may use a non-university member for the
pilot if desired. Qualified, volunteer pilots will be available at the contest on an as-available basis to assist teams who
are unable to have their pilot attend.
             
There is no set requirement for the number of students that must attend the fly-off. It is preferred, but not required,
for the team advisor or responsible faculty member to attend.
             
Team members may be updated/changed at any time during the contest but must always comply with the 1/3 rule.
Following the initial team roster submitted with the contest entry, a ‚ÄúOne Time‚Äù update to the official team roster
may be submitted with the Design Report in February.
             
Each educational institution may submit one (1) team entry.
             
The team members may be changed during the contest period, so schools may use an internal selection process to
determine their final design and team members prior to the written report submission and fly-off. For schools with
multiple campuses in different cities each campus will be considered as a separate entity.
             
Two or more schools may combine to submit a single entry.
             
Schools which already have an entry may not have additional students from their school participate as members of a
team from a different (shadow) school.

1. Verify all components are adequately secured to the vehicle. Verify all permanent fasteners are tight and
have either safety wire, thread locker (LoctiteTM), or nuts/screws with a mechanical interference fit such as
nylon inserts or patches or self-locking threads. Clevises on flight controls must have an appropriate
mechanical locking device to prevent their disengaging in flight.
2. Verify all hatches and access panels have a positive, mechanical latching method to assure it does not come
loose in flight. Spring latches, fasteners, cotter pins, tape, etc are examples of acceptable methods. Magnets are not an acceptable latching method. Velcro may be an acceptable method depending on the implementation, but a secondary method may be required at the discretion of the technical inspector.
3. Verify propeller structural and attachment integrity.
4. Visual inspection of all electronic wiring to assure adequate wire gauges and connectors in use.
5. Radio range check with motor off and motor on.
6. Verify all controls move in the proper sense.
7. Check the general integrity of the payload system.
      
Structural verification:

The airplane will be lifted with one lift point at each wing tip to verify adequate wing strength (this is "roughly"
equivalent to a 2.5g load case) and to check for vehicle cg location. Teams must mark the expected empty and
loaded cg locations on the exterior of the airplane. Special provisions will be made at the time of the contest for
airplanes whose cg does not fall within the wing tip chord. This test will be made with the airplane filled to its
maximum payload and battery (combination) capacity.
Radio fail-safe check:
All airplane radios must have a fail-safe mode that is automatically selected during loss of transmit signal. The fail-
safe will be demonstrated on the ground by switching off the transmit radio. During fail-safe the airplane receiver
must command:
- Throttle closed
- Full up elevator
- Full right rudder
- Full right aileron
- Full Flaps down

of the propeller(s) for pusher airplanes, and standing behind the propeller(s) for tractor airplanes (i.e. the crew
member must not reach across the propeller plane to access the fuse). The "Safety Arming Device" will be in "Safe"
mode for all payload changes. The airplane Rx should always be powered on and the throttle verified to be "closed"
before activating the motor arming switch. Fuses MUST be mounted on the outside of the airplane (they can not be
behind an access panel or door) and MUST act as the "safing" device. Note: The airplane must be ‚Äúsafed‚Äù (arming
fuse removed) any time the airplane is being manually moved, or while loading/unloading payloads during the

In the event that, due to time or facility limitations, it is not possible to allow all teams to have the maximum number
of flight attempts, the contest committee reserves the right to ration and/or schedule flights. The exact
determination of how to ration flights will be made on the contest day based on the number of entries, weather, and
field conditions. In the event of a tie, Report Score will take precedence over Flight Score as a tie-breaker.

Students must design, document, fabricate, and demonstrate the airplane they determine to be capable of achieving
the highest score on the specified mission profile(s). Mission scores will be based on the demonstrated mission
performance obtained during the contest.
             
Each team must also submit a written Design Report. A maximum of 100 points will be awarded for the team design
report. The overall team score is a combination of the Design Report score and Total Mission Score. The team with
the highest overall team score will be declared the winner. Scores will be FINAL 7 working days after the completion
of the contest. This period will allow for review of the scores in a timely fashion following the contest.
